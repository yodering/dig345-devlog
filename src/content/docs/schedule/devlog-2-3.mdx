# DevLog 2-3: Create an Astro Blog Site

Follow Astro's Build a Blog tutorial to create a modular website using component-based design. Compare your finished blog site to the tutorial example as needed. Copy and paste then complete the following objectives in your DevLog (Instructions).

1. Create a new Astro site and publish it on Netlify[^1]. Write the formatted command ✏️ here using `backticks` so you remember it.

2. Create pages (`.astro` files) and blog posts (`.md` files) using frontmatter and file-based routing[^2].

3. Use Astro components (also `.astro` files!) to reuse common code across your website[^3].

4. Create reusable layout components using `<slot />` and `Astro.props` to inject child content[^4].

5. Create layout components for markdown files. Share anything that was difficult so far ✏️ here.

6. Display a dynamically generated list of posts on your Blog page[^5].

7. Use Dynamic page routing with `getStaticPaths()` to specify and store static routes during build, and pass each page its own props.

8. Install Astro Preact integration. Use a `client:` directive for hydration on a UI framework component[^6]. 🔥 **Challenge:** Already have experience with a UI library? Try to integrate that one instead! For example, I used Svelte.

9. Modify your site design and content as if you were transitioning to Astro.js from an existing Wordpress site/blog. Duplicate the design, content, structure from the other site (not entirely, mind you, since this is just a mockup). Publish your blog site and put the url ✏️ here.

10. Copy and paste these instructions into `devlog-2-3.mdx` in your own DevLog. Publish it. Then turn it in by posting a direct link to the page on Moodle.
